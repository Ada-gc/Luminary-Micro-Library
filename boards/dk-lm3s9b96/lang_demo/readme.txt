Graphics Library String Table Demonstration

This application provides a demonstration of the capabilities of the
Stellaris Graphics Library's string table functions.  Two panels show
different implementations of features of the string table functions.
For each panel, the bottom provides a forward and back button
(when appropriate).

The first panel provides a large string with introductory text and basic
instructions for operation of the application.

The second panel shows the available languages and allows them to be
switched between English, German, Spanish and Italian.
